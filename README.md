##  Why This Project Was Needed❓

Many businesses struggle with supply chain visibility. Delays, overstocking, and inefficient shipping routes can hurt profitability. This dashboard helps fix that by turning complex data into easy-to-understand visuals and insights such as:

- Which suppliers have the most inventory?
- How much are we spending on shipping?
- Which delivery priorities are delayed?
- What’s the shipping status across orders?
